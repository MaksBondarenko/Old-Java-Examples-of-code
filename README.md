# old-java-examples-of-code
When I studied at university, i wrote this code and decided to save this for the future to remind me of something and see what mistakes I was doing during that time.

All folders are different programs.

1) WalkFileTree is program where you need to put your folder path in GUI and all content from .txt extension files in that directory and subdirectories will be copied to Result.txt in project folder.

2) SortGame is a simple GUI game in which you must sort random number of colors in table. Sort rule: all red items need to be placed at the bottom of table. At the end if you have a result which is better then other's results - your name and score will be placed in highscores list.
